      "\n",
      " - `__init__`: how to initialize me\n",
      " - `__str__`: how to print me (more generally, how to get a string from me)\n",
      " - `__bool_`: how to know if I am True or False (e.g. if used in an `if` statement)\n",
      " - `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, etc.: how to use arithmetic on me\n",
      " - `__iadd__`, `__isub__`, etc.: how to use in-place arithmetic on me\n",
      " - `__radd__`, `__rsub__`, etc.: how to add (etc.) me on the right (if the object on the left has no `__add__` method.\n",
      " - `__eq__`: how to know if I am equal to some other thing\n",
      " - `__len__`: how long am I\n",
      " - `__getitem__`: how to index into me using square brackets\n",
      " - `__iter__`: how to get an iterator from me. If I have `__iter__`, I am an *iterable*. (Often `__iter__` just returns `self`, in which case the object is its own iterator)\n",
      " - `__next__`: how to get the next item from me. If I have `__next__`, I am an *iterator*.\n",
      " - `__call__`: how to call me (i.e. putting parentheses after me). If I have `__call__`, I am a *callable*.\n",
      " \n",
      "There are also magic attributes, though they are less common.\n",
      "For example here are two that a function will have:\n",
      "\n",
      " - `__name__`: the name of the function\n",
